# **Motivation and Problem Statement**


This project will analyze wage data for City of Seattle employees to understand how salaries vary across different departments and job roles. The goal is to explore factors that might affect salary levels and look for any noticeable differences in pay. This analysis could help uncover patterns and trends that might inform city policies on fair and balanced compensation. By studying this data, I hope to learn more about what influences public sector pay in Seattle and gain insights into how wages are distributed among different roles within city government.


# **Data Selected for Analysis**


The dataset chosen for this project is the City of Seattle Wage Data, available on the Seattle Open Data portal. It includes information on wages, job titles, and departments for Seattle city employees as of July 2024, with around 13,000 records.

- License: This dataset is in the public domain, which means it’s free to use without restrictions.
- Relevance: This dataset is a good fit because it provides real salary data across many job roles and departments, allowing for a practical look at public sector pay in Seattle. The - open license means there are no legal issues with using it for analysis.
- Ethical Considerations: Since this data is public, there are no privacy concerns. However, I will be careful to interpret the results responsibly to avoid generalizing about individual employees based on limited data points.

  
# **Unknowns and Dependencies**


One potential limitation of this project is that the dataset doesn’t include demographic information (like gender or years of experience), which could help explain pay differences. Another factor to consider is the need for recent data, as any updates in employee roles or pay policies could impact the analysis. Since the city is updating its HR system, there could be delays in new data releases, which may limit access to the most current information. Based on feedback from classmates, I plan to clearly explain any patterns or differences in pay that I find.
